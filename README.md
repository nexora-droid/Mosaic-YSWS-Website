## What is MOSAIC?
Mosaic is a _full stack_ YSWS (you ship, we ship) programme part of Hack Club. The main goal of _Mosaic_ is to empower teen coders to build amazing full stack web applications using languages of their choice! It can be made using Python, HTML, CSS and JS or anything they wish to use! 
The estimated duration for Mosaic is ~1 year so we hope it creates an enjoyable experience for all of us.

Mosaic works on one _key point_: build a web app (that works obviously!!) on the theme you get! Every month Mosaic will have a new theme and participants within Hack Club can particiapte and earn rewards for their projects - judged by a reviewing team and Hack Club Fraud team. _Reviewing team members will not be disclosed soon._

Mosaic is open to all Hack Club members between ages of 13-18, according to Hack Club regulations.
Every project will need to be tracked via _Hackatime_ and time-fraud, vibe-coding and usage of AI other than debugging are prohibited. For more details please view the _Consitution of Tilemakers_ placed in the Slack Channel (as of November 2025).

## What is the current theme?
The current theme is: **YET TO BE DISCLOSED (website still in progress)**.

## Shop items?
