            <p>Mosaic is similar to <i>Siege</i> but for frontend/backend development! <br> Every month, a random theme is announced and the participants - which is probably YOU - build a full-stack website/application about that theme! A judging team will review your project in 1 week, and you will be awarded Tiles - our currency - based on the quality of your project!

            <p>
                You do <span style="color:red;">not need to participate every month</span>.  
                If you work on the <span style="color:red;">current month’s theme</span>, the minimum requirement is <span style="color:red;">30 hours</span>.  
                If you <span style="color:red;">miss a month</span> and later decide to complete that theme, the requirement becomes <span style="color:red;">50 hours (one-time)</span>.  
                After completing that, you can return to <span style="color:red;">30-hour projects</span> for future themes. Or even possibly smaller projects for the same theme that add up to 30 hours.
