            <p>Mosaic is similar to <i>Siege</i> but for frontend/backend development! <br> Every month, a random theme is announced and the participants - which is probably YOU - build a full-stack website/application about that theme! A judging team will review your project in 1 week, and you will be awarded Tiles - our currency - based on the quality of your project!
